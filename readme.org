* What?
A single file header only library that provides a few bitpacked data structures
- ~UInt_pair~ stores a pair in the bits of a single integer type.
- ~tagged_ptr~ stores a pointer plus some data in the bottom few bits.
- ~variant_ptr~ stores a pointer plus a tag that indicates which type it points to
* Examples?
I haven't written them here yet, but you will find some basic usage in ~tests/test.cpp~
