* What?
A header only library that provides a few bitpacked data structures
- ~UInt_pair~ stores a pair in the bits of a single integer type.
- ~tagged_ptr~ stores a pointer plus some data in the bottom few bits.
- ~variant_ptr~ stores a pointer plus a tag that indicates which type it points to
These are useful building blocks for creating cache-friendly data structures.

These are intended to be somewhat interopable with ~std::pair~ and ~std::variant~, with some limitations. Also, ~tagged_ptr~'s interface is losely modeled off of ~std::unique~ and ~std::shared~.
* Examples?
I haven't written them here yet, but you will find some basic usage in ~tests/test.cpp~
